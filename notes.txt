easy testing process -> Rakefile, racatt gem
stable environment -> Gemfile
Clarity -> Cucumber features
testing the 'fiddly bits' -> RSpec

'case' strings could just as easily be binary strings. Pipe or underscore doesn't make a

Future development
-------------------
priority:
Finish executable file for demoing

backlog:
Finish remaining user stories (see requirements)
Handle bad input files (e.g. files whose line count is not a multiple of 4, files that don't have more or less than 9 digits in account numbers)
